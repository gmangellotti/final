◕ ◞ ◕ This project was made using https://netnet.studio

This project is mainly a digital garden, but in the style of the early web. While reflecting on the 'magic' surrounding the internet, I decided to
materialize the magic, through its machine and design, in a digital garden. The garden starts with my first experiences with computers and the internet and progesses as you scroll down the page. The very chunky desktops are presented on the top of the page. When I was younger I would play with the computer in my father's workspace. Most of the games involved Winnie the Pooh. I did not 'surf' the internet at this age, but popups existed and I demonstrated that through the popup gif on the first computer's screen. Next, the thinner desktop represent elementary school. We often had to write Microsoft Word reports on what we learned in Science and in Social Studies. I included a .gif of Microsoft Word and the Clippy character that helped with mistakes, similar to netnet. Next, the first apple laptop -- white and chunky. My dad is a big fan of Apple; he could not get through his CS classes in college and this computer was a lot more accessible for us. Then, the cascade of Apple products follows. The main point of this project is to capture the machines that produce the internet magic. This project can be applied to many people as they reflect on their experiences with technology and materialized those memories in a space on the internet.
