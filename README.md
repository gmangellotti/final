◕ ◞ ◕ This project was made using https://netnet.studio

This project is mainly a digital garden, but in the style of the early web. While reflecting on the 'magic' surrounding the internet, I decided to
materialize the magic in a digital garden. The garden starts with my first experiences with computers and the internet and progesses as you scroll
down the page. The point of this project is to capture the machines that produce the magic. With time, greater details will come.
